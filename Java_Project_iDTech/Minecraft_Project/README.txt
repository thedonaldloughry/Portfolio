MOD: All Of The Everything (formerly Don's Mod)

DESCRIPTION: This is a mod featuring a wide array of additions to the vanilla 
Minecraft game. These include new blocks, items, placeable tile entities, living 
entities, biomes, armor types, ore types, sound effects, and hopefully much more in 
future updates. 
	This repository was created for the sake of preserving the code, but if you 
just so happened to stumble across this repository, check back later to see if there's
anything new!

CURRENT PROGRESS: Mostly code cleanup. This project was a long learning process for me, one that involved a lot of "get it to work" code, private research, and many pots of coffee. If you're looking at this project now, what you'll see is ultimately an unfinished product, one that I hope to at least release before this version of Minecraft is completely irrelevant. But nonetheless, this project shows my experience learning Java. I had the opportunity to  learn it while doing something that I enjoyed, and for that I'm grateful.
